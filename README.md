## Age Category Classification

This project provides a simple example of how to classify a person's age into different categories using Java. The program determines the appropriate age category based on predefined age ranges and prints a corresponding message.

## Features:
- Defines an integer variable (`age`) to represent the person's age.
- Categorizes the age into one of the following groups:
  - `age < 0`: "Invalid age"
  - `0 - 1 years`: "baby"
  - `2 - 12 years`: "child"
  - `13 - 17 years`: "teenager"
  - `18 - 64 years`: "adult"
  - `65 and above`: "old"
- Utilizes `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to determine and print the age category.

## Code Breakdown:
- `int age = 20;` initializes the age variable. Change this value to test different age categories.
- The program uses conditional statements to classify the age and display the appropriate category.

## Usage:
Run the Java program and observe how it categorizes different age values. Modify the `age` variable to test various age ranges and see the output.

## Additional Information:
- **Invalid Age Handling:** The program checks for negative age values and outputs "Invalid age" if detected.
- **Age Categories:** The classification includes five categories ranging from "baby" to "old".
